proxy.pac
=========

URL-filtering is a pain, it forced me to lost an hour of my work time to
install tor, configure it and learn a bit about the proxy.pac file.

These efforts led to this script, which redirects through the tor
network all requests to a list of hosts and let everything else flow
normaly.

And now I can browse reddit.
